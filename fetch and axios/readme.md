| Axios has url in request object.                                         | Fetch has no url in request object.                                                                                                         |
| Axios is a stand-alone third party package that can be easily installed. | Fetch is built into most modern browsers; no installation is required as such.                                                              |
| Axios enjoys built-in XSRF protection.                                   | Fetch does not.                                                                                                                             |
| Axios uses the data property.                                            | Fetch uses the body property.                                                                                                               |
| Axios’ data contains the object.                                         | Fetch’s body has to be stringified.                                                                                                         |
| Axios request is ok when status is 200 and statusText is ‘OK’.           | Fetch request is ok when response object contains the ok property.                                                                          |
| Axios performs automatic transforms of JSON data.                        | Fetch is a two-step process when handling JSON data- first, to make the actual request; second, to call the .json() method on the response. |
| Axios allows cancelling request and request timeout.                     | Fetch does not.                                                                                                                             |
| Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests.                        | Fetch, by default, doesn’t provide a way to intercept requests.                                                                             |
| Axios has built-in support for download progress.                        | Fetch does not support upload progress.                                                                                                     |
| Axios has wide browser support.                                          | Fetch only supports Chrome 42+, Firefox 39+, Edge 14+, and Safari 10.1+ (This is known as Backward Compatibility).                          |
